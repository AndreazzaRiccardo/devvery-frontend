<p style="font-weight: bolder">Let me introduce you to Devvery, the delivery app developed in collaboration with my team. Its captivating design and ease of use make it a perfect example of how a similar project could be realized.</p>
<p>As we can see, the homepage is elegant and dynamic, with a style that evokes the desire to eat.</p>

<p>Once the user has performed a search by category or by name, the page will display the results in the form of cards</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>Once the user has decided from which restaurant to order, they will be redirected to the menu page.</p>

<br><br>
<p>From there, users will be able to order the desired food items and add them to the cart.</p>

<br><br>
<p>Once the ordering is finished, users can proceed to the checkout page to complete the payment. The payment system is fully implemented, and once confirmed, it sends the order to the restaurant's backend page and sends a confirmation email.</p>
